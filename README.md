It was so painful the cramps i had were unbearable it was as if a great white shark has eaten my stomach. I clenched my fist and hit it against a wall on a deserted street where vermin lived in. Soon i felt something caressing my luscious black hair with lime green roots. " Those are nice hair of yours can i have it?" The voice was soft as if the person whispered but the darkness soon fell on its words and engulfed it in flames. Making it seem like a death threat, I turned around there was nothing. I must have been over thinking. I have gone insane, i hold out my hand and the pills were there.
